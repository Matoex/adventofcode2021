# Day 7

## a)
### Slightly modified version of Fibonacci's rabbot growth. Given a List of ages, how many rabbits are there afte 80 days? It takes 8 days for a newborn and 6 days for an adult to reproduce (again).

## b)
### How many after 256 day?

First I tried to live it using Lists of ages, but that went big quickly.

Then I saved the numer of rabbits with age i in an array at index i and shifted these accordingly.
